               people skills and attention to detail. Responsible and trustworthy. Demonstrates
               strong ethics geared towards making every customer satisficed. Very enthusiastic
               go get any job done. Excellent communication skills with fluency in English and Russian.
               Proficient computer skills. I started to learn programming about 5 month ago. I learned
               it by myself and find it interesting to me, so decide go to the bootcamp.
               I find Coding temple best option for me, because here is actually what I want to learn
               and most of the stuff that we will learn, I familiar with. I use to deal with HTML,
               CSS, Python, SQL, Python Django, so hopefully my small experience will help me
               and compensate my english.
